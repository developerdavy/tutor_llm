IMPORTANT: WordPress Plugin Setup Instructions

The AI Tutor is a WordPress PLUGIN, not a separate website.

HOW TO USE:
1. Install the plugin in your WordPress site
2. Create a WordPress page 
3. Add the shortcode [ai_tutor_dashboard] to the page
4. Visit that PAGE on your WordPress site

WHAT YOU'RE DOING WRONG:
- Trying to access AI Tutor as a separate website/domain
- Looking for a standalone URL

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- Access it through your WordPress site
- Use the shortcodes on WordPress pages
- The AI Tutor appears WITHIN your existing WordPress pages

Example:
- Your site: example.com
- Create page: example.com/learning
- Add shortcode to that page
- Visit: example.com/learning (AI Tutor appears there)

The AI Tutor is embedded content, not a separate site!
