IMPORTANT: WordPress Plugin Setup Instructions

The AI Tutor is a WordPress PLUGIN, not a separate website.

FOR LOCAL WORDPRESS:
1. Copy ai-tutor-wordpress-plugin folder to: wp-content/plugins/
2. Activate plugin in WordPress admin
3. Create WordPress page with shortcode [ai_tutor_dashboard]
4. Visit that page at your local WordPress URL

EXAMPLE FOR LOCAL SETUP:
- Your local WordPress: http://localhost/wordpress
- WordPress admin: http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin
- Create page: "Learning Dashboard" 
- Add shortcode: [ai_tutor_dashboard]
- Visit: http://localhost/wordpress/learning-dashboard

COMMON LOCAL PATHS:
- XAMPP: C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\plugins\
- WAMP: C:\wamp64\www\wordpress\wp-content\plugins\
- MAMP: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/
- Local by Flywheel: [site-folder]/app/public/wp-content/plugins/

WHAT YOU'RE DOING WRONG:
- Trying to access AI Tutor as a separate website/domain
- Looking for a standalone URL like aisite.com

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
- Access through your existing LOCAL WordPress site
- The AI Tutor appears WITHIN your WordPress pages
- Use your normal WordPress URL + the page you created

The AI Tutor is embedded content, not a separate site!
