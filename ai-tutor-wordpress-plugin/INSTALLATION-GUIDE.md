   - **MAMP**: `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/`
   - **Local**: Your site folder ‚Üí `app/public/wp-content/plugins/`

2. Go to your local WordPress admin (e.g., `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin`)

2. Title: "Learning Dashboard" 
3. Content: `[ai_tutor_dashboard]`

## Important Notes

‚úÖ **Correct Usage:** Access through WordPress pages with shortcodes
‚ùå **Incorrect:** Trying to access as a separate website/domain

The AI Tutor runs WITHIN your existing WordPress site, not as a standalone application.

## Troubleshooting

### "This site can't be reached" Error
This means you're trying to access the wrong URL. The AI Tutor is not a separate website - it's embedded in your WordPress pages.

**Solution:** 
1. Go to your WordPress site
2. Visit the page where you added the `[ai_tutor_dashboard]` shortcode
3. The AI Tutor interface will appear on that page

### Plugin Not Showing
1. Verify the plugin is activated in WordPress admin
2. Check that you've added the shortcode to a published page
3. Ensure your theme supports shortcodes

### No Subjects/Lessons Appearing
1. Go to **AI Tutor ‚Üí Dashboard** in WordPress admin
2. Check if default content was created
3. Manually add subjects and lessons if needed

## Sample Page Setup

Here's exactly what to do:

1. **WordPress Admin ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Add New**
2. **Title:** "AI Learning Platform"
3. **Content:** 
   ```
   Welcome to our AI Learning Platform!
   
   [ai_tutor_dashboard]
   ```
4. **Click Publish**
5. **Visit the page** - this is where your AI Tutor will be
